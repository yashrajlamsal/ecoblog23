We would like to extend a warm welcome to our website, which has been developed by Yash Raj Lamsal, an assistant professor of economics at Kathmandu University. Our aim is to provide an exceptional learning experience to all students, educators, and individuals interested in understanding macroeconomic variables, their analysis, and data representation through visually appealing charts and graphs.
