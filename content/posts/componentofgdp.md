This pie chart and table present recent data about the four different components of the United States' Gross Domestic Product (GDP), including their corresponding amounts and percentages. Examining the table, we can see that the total GDP of the United States in Q4 of 2022 was valued at 26.14 trillion US dollars. Consumption was the biggest contributor to the GDP, amounting to 17.74 trillion US dollars, which makes up 67.91% of the total GDP. Investment followed next, contributing 4.66 trillion US dollars, which accounts for 17.87% of the GDP, while the government contributed 4.57 trillion US dollars, representing 17.50% of the GDP.

### The components of US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the year 2020
{{< figure src="/images/us/pie.svg">}}
GDP is divided into four parts: Consumption, Investment, Government Purchase, and Net Export. Net export is export minus import. These four parts are various forms of spending on domestically produced goods and services. The table shows the dollar value of components of the GDP and their percentage of the total. The table provides a percentage value of total for different components, where the share of import is subtracted. The pie chart only represents the comparative size of components of the GDP and discards negative sign of import.
